Matthew's Movie Memories App

 2024 version 1.1

=====

Problem:

Sometimes you want to be able to keep track of movies you've watched and be able to remember how good it was. I constantly forget if I liked a movie all the time, or if I've even watched the movie for that matter. Being able to easily track that makes it so much easier to be able to know what you've seen. Also if someone asks you for your top 5 movies you can tell them without hesitation. 

test:

I open the app and I can see what movies I've watched. I can then rank it and show what my top 5 (or possibly more?) movies are. I can share the app and let my friends see what I've watched and ranked movies(so they can scrutinize the ranking).

user story:

as a "movie enjoyer",
i want to "track and rank movies i've seen"
so that "i can remember movies and share the rankings"
